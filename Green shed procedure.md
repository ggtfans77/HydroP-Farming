In Maharashtra, the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) is primarily implemented through the MahaDBT Farmer Portal. Starting from the 2025–2026 financial year, the state has transitioned to a "First Come, First Served" approach for selecting beneficiaries. 
Online Registration: Visit the MahaDBT Portal and click on "New Applicant Registration".
Aadhaar Authentication: Use your Aadhaar number for OTP-based verification to auto-populate personal and bank details.
Profile Completion: Complete your profile to 100% by entering permanent address details, domicile, and caste information (if applicable). 
Step 2: Application Submission
Select Scheme: Log in and navigate to "Agriculture Department Schemes." Select the relevant horticulture component (e.g., area expansion, protected cultivation, or mechanization).
Upload Documents: You must provide digital copies of the following:
7/12 Extract and 8-A Certificate (Land ownership records).
Caste Certificate (for SC/ST beneficiaries to claim higher subsidy rates).
Quotations: For equipment or project costs from approved dealers.
Self-Declaration and a recent passport-size photograph.
Pay Fees: Pay the required online application fee to finalize your submission. 
Step 3: Approval and Sanction
Selection Process: Applications are selected based on the timestamp of submission ("First Come, First Served").
Verification: The Block or District Horticulture Officer verifies the data and project plan.
Pre-Sanction Letter: If approved, you will receive a Pre-Sanction Letter via the portal. Do not start any work or purchase equipment before receiving this letter. 
Step 4: Implementation and Inspection
Project Execution: Complete the work (e.g., planting an orchard or building a polyhouse) within the specified timeline, usually 12 months.
Joint Inspection: After completion, a Joint Inspection Team (JIT) including state officers and bank officials (if credit-linked) will visit your farm to verify that the work matches technical standards. 
Step 5: Subsidy Disbursement
Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT): Once the inspection report is approved, the subsidy is credited directly to your Aadhaar-linked bank account.
Back-Ended Subsidy: For large projects (like cold storage or polyhouses), the subsidy is "back-ended," meaning it is released to your bank to adjust against your loan principal after project completion.
